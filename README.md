✨ About Me

I am a Data Science graduate with a focus on Machine Learning.

I am a professional passionate about data culture and its ability to transform information into business value. I have experience in implementing Data Lakes on Databricks integrated with Azure Data Lake, developing efficient ETL/ELT pipelines using Azure Data Factory and Delta Lake. My work covers everything from structuring data layers to optimizing pipelines for integration with Synapse Analytics and Power BI.

Additionally, I have participated in the implementation of a data hub, structuring databases and developing interactive dashboards in Power BI and QlikSense. My approach goes beyond visualization, covering the creation of metrics, definition of concepts and goals, applying best practices in RLS (Row-Level Security), and optimizing data architecture for each type of processing.

I worked directly on the development of the entire logistics planning data hub, from database modeling to integration with Power Apps, facilitating the identification of improvements and validation of action plans. I also developed a BI portal in Django, centralizing reports, documentation, and new demands. Currently, I am leading the migration of the environment to a Data Lake on Databricks.

My experience also includes creating advanced reports and dashboards in Power BI, covering ETL, complex data manipulation, and developing strategic insights for areas such as merchandising, Supply Chain, and finance. I use advanced knowledge in DAX, M, R, and Python, as well as create custom visuals with FIGMA and HTML.

I am constantly seeking to improve processes and drive data-driven decision-making, ensuring efficiency and innovation in the solutions I implement.
